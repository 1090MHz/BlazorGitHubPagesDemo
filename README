# Blazor GitHub Pages Demo

This repository demonstrates deploying a Blazor WebAssembly application to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Blazor WebAssembly**: A single-page application framework for building interactive web UIs.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages using the `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow for building and publishing the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Version 9.0 or compatible)
- A GitHub repository with GitHub Pages enabled.

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1090MHz/BlazorGitHubPagesDemo.git
   cd BlazorGitHubPagesDemo

2. Build and run the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
### Troubleshooting

You should select "Read and write permissions" for your workflows. This is necessary because the JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action requires write access to the repository to push changes to the gh-pages branch.

Steps to Update:
Go to your repository's Settings > Actions > General.
Under Workflow permissions, select Read and write permissions.
Save the changes.
This will allow the GitHub Actions bot to push to the gh-pages branch and resolve the 403 Permission Denied error.
